This is the code repository for [Learning Robotics using Python - Second Edition](https://www.packtpub.com/hardware-and-creative/learning-robotics-using-python-second-edition?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788623315), published by Packt.

**Design, simulate, program, and prototype an autonomous mobile robot using ROS, OpenCV, PCL, and Python**

## What is this book about?
Robot Operating System (ROS) is one of the most popular robotics software frameworks in research and industry. It has various features for implementing different capabilities in a robot without implementing them from scratch.

This book covers the following exciting features: 
* Design a differential robot from scratch
* Model a differential robot using ROS and URDF
* Simulate a differential robot using ROS and Gazebo
* Design robot hardware electronics
* Interface robot actuators with embedded boards

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cylinder_add(radius=0.006,
depth=0.04, location=(0.12,0,0.075))
bpy.context.object.rotation_euler[1] = 1.5708

```

**Following is what you need for this book:**

This book is for those who are conducting research in mobile robotics and autonomous navigation. As well as the robotics research domain, this book is also for the robot hobbyist community. You’re expected to have a basic understanding of Linux commands and Python.

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-15).
